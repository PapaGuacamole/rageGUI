###INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:###
Download the BattleRage_GUI.xml file and import into Mudlet using the package manager.

To use default configuration options, simply enter **ragebuild** to build the GUI.

To change configuration options, navigate to the script BattleRage/Battlerage config and update the values there.

To save your updates, use **ragesave**. They will be automatically loaded next time you load your profile.

To manually load your saved settings, use **rageload**.

Set the name of the person to benefit from ally rage abilities using **rageally _person_**, eg **rageally klendathu**. There is no check that it's a valid adventurer, so type carefully!
